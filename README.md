# My get started with streamlit

This repo shows a simple code for creating a streamlit page. I used the iris dataset from sklearn datasets module. The web page just show a histogram plot and head from dataframe.

I Learned with [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4bjv6e5goo&ab_channel=SynapseDataScience) from Synapse Data Science channel. Very basic, but very good.
